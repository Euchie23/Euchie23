I'm a recent graduate experienced in applying **data science** to questions in **marine ecology**, **environmental sustainability**, and **pollution impact analysis**. My work includes studying pollutants in marine species as bioindicators, as well as estimating stock abundance to support ecological insights.

## üë©‚Äçüíª Projects

The projects are currently stored and worked on in a private repo (Squid_Fest), then curated into public repositories (SquidStack, SquidStock, and GeoTentacles). Active development and version control take place in the private repository (Squid_fest) to allow for faster iteration and maintainability. The squid_Fest repo includes additional modules, in-progress work and full codebase for all the dashboards that may not yet be stable or documented. <br> üì¨ Feel free to contact me if you're interested in collaborating or reviewing the private repository.<br><br>
