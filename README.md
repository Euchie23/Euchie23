I'm a recent graduate experienced in applying **data science** to questions in **marine ecology**, **environmental sustainability**, and **pollution impact analysis**. My work includes studying pollutants in marine species as bioindicators, as well as estimating stock abundance to support ecological insights.

## 👩‍💻 Projects

The projects are currently stored and worked on in a private repo (Squid_Fest), then curated into public repositories (SquidStack, SquidStock, and GeoTentacles). 📬 Feel free to contact me if you're interested in collaborating or reviewing the private repository.<br><br>
**<a href="https://github.com/Euchie23/SquidStack/" target="_blank">SquidStack</a> — Applied Data Science Projects from Masters Thesis** <br>
- A collection of modular analytics and dashboards revealing the thesis progression:
  - [🧱 Foundation](https://euchie23.shinyapps.io/foundation/) - Intro/methods and validation workflows
  - 🧪 Exploration(*Coming soon*) - Data mining and detection summaries visualization and intepretation
  - 📈 Fluctuation(*Coming soon*) - Temporal trends and seasonal patterns based on industrial activities
  - ⚠️ Risk Evaluation(*Coming soon*) - Human health risk modeling and interpretation for Argentina and Taiwan<br><br>
  
**SquidStock** *(Coming Soon)*  
  Stock assessment models using CPUE standardization, AutoML, and biomass forecasting under climate scenarios. Interactive dashboards to follow. <br><br>

**GeoTentacles** *(Coming Soon)*  
  Spatial analytics for marine species using PostgreSQL, PostGIS, and QGIS. Focused on distribution mapping and conservation planning.
