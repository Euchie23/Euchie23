# Hi, I’m Euchie 👋🌱

> *“A stitch in time saves nine.”*  
> I build **risk-aware, decision-support tools** that turn complex environmental, spatial, and safety data into **early warnings and defensible insights**.

I'm an **interdisciplinary environmental scientist and applied data practitioner** with a foundation in business, which informs my structured, outcome-oriented approach to turning complex environmental, spatial, and safety data into actionable insights.<br>
Trained academically in Asia and with hands-on experience in **regulated industrial environments**, my work sits at the intersection of **environmental science, spatial analytics, and applied risk intelligence**, with a focus on **monitoring, prioritization, and prevention**.<br><br>

## 🎓 Background
**Marine Environmental Science + Applied Data Science**  
MSc Biodiversity — National Taiwan University (Taiwan)  
Originally trained in business, bringing operational insight and analytical rigor to environmental data and decision-support work.  
Currently based in **Saint Lucia**

---

## 💡 What I Do
I design **decision tools**, not just analyses.

That means:
- validating data before interpreting it
- making uncertainty explicit
- translating outputs into **screening-level intelligence** people can actually use

Target environments include:
**environmental consultancies, regulators, NGOs, sustainability teams, and applied data groups**.

## 🦺 HSE–Q Risk Intelligence (Personal Project)

Alongside my current role as **Contracted HSE-Q Support** on a **regulated oil & gas infrastructure construction project**, I am building a **professional-grade HSE–Q risk intelligence system**.

**System scope:**
- PostgreSQL schema (DDL)
- Reproducible risk scoring logic (SQL)
- Shiny dashboard wireframes
- ML-ready feature design (future)

📌 **Conceptual Risk Intelligence Model**  
*(Placeholder — high-level ERD diagram showing task-centered risk flow)*  
> Diagram to be added (e.g. draw.io / diagrams.net)

<summary><strong>📖 About My Work Philosophy</strong></summary>

I don’t optimize for hype or black-box performance.  
I build systems that make **assumptions visible**, **uncertainty explicit**, and **decisions defensible** — especially where environmental and human consequences matter.
