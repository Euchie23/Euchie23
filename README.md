I'm a recent graduate experienced in applying **data science** to questions in **marine ecology**, **environmental sustainability**, and **pollution impact analysis**. My work includes studying pollutants in marine species as bioindicators, as well as estimating stock abundance to support ecological insights.

## 👩‍💻 Projects

The projects are currently stored and worked on in a private repo (Squid_Fest), then curated into public repositories (SquidStack, SquidStock, and GeoTentacles). Active development and version control take place in the private repository (Squid_fest) to allow for faster iteration and maintainability. The squid_Fest repo includes additional modules, in-progress work and full codebase for all the dashboards that may not yet be stable or documented. <br> 📬 Feel free to contact me if you're interested in collaborating or reviewing the private repository.<br><br>

**<a href="https://github.com/Euchie23/SquidStock/" target="_blank">SquidStock</a> - Long‑Term Catch Analytics & Predictive Models for Sustainable Fisheries** <br>
- A collection of notebooks and streamlit apps that illustrate stock assessment models using CPUE standardization, predictive catch models using AutoML, and biomass forecasting under climate scenarios. Interactive dashboards include: 
  - 📈 [Temporal CPUE Analysis](https://github.com/Euchie23/SquidStock/blob/main/notebooks/Temporal_Catch_Analysis/Temporal_Catch_Analysis.ipynb) - Explores historical CPUE trends and environmental drivers, highlighting seasonal and interannual variability. Enables fisheries managers to detect stock stress, allocate effort strategically, and understand long-term population dynamics. [Click here for README](https://github.com/Euchie23/SquidStock/tree/main/notebooks/Temporal_Catch_Analysis)
  - 📊 [CPUE Standardization & Prediction](https://github.com/Euchie23/SquidStock/blob/main/notebooks/CPUE_Standardization_&_Prediction/CPUE_Standardization_&_Prediction.ipynb) - Applies GAMs and Tweedie regressors to normalize CPUE, separating ecological signal from operational noise. Supports short-term forecasting and provides interpretable model diagnostics for informed decision-making. [Click here for README](https://github.com/Euchie23/SquidStock/tree/main/notebooks/CPUE_Standardization_&_Prediction) or [Click here for App](https://squidstock-course-correction.streamlit.app)
  - 🌡️ [Biomass Simulation under warming Scenarios](https://github.com/Euchie23/SquidStock/blob/main/notebooks/Biomass_Forecasting/Biomass_Forecasting_Environment.ipynb) – Models Illex argentinus biomass under environmental variability and warming projections using a nonlinear EDPSM. Supports proactive management by illustrating potential stock responses to climate change and guiding adaptive harvest strategies. [Click here for README](https://github.com/Euchie23/SquidStock/tree/main/notebooks/Biomass_Forecasting) or [Click here for App](https://squidstock-ocean-dynamics.streamlit.app)
  - ⚙️ [Predictive Squid Catch Models using AutoML](https://github.com/Euchie23/SquidStock/blob/main/notebooks/AutoML/AutoML.ipynb) – Implements a full, production-ready ML workflow to predict weekly CPUE for short-lived, mobile squid. Includes feature engineering, class-conditioned regression, anomaly detection, and drift monitoring. Helps operational teams anticipate high- or low-catch weeks while explicitly flagging uncertainty in medium-CPUE regimes.
